# Async Notes

* Look at the problem, what is the fastest it could go

* Run - 1.2 seconds - use var
* Change to Task.Delay and Wait
* Use .Result - still 1.2 seconds
* Add await and make everything async, but directly await the tasks
* Separately create and await the task. Watch where the OJ pouring goes. 

* Why is pouring coffee different than frying an egg?

* What if there was a waiter?
